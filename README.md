# SomaAI
Decentralized AI computation network building on Somnia network. 

SomaAI is a decentralized AI computation network building on the Somnia blockchain, enabling scalable, affordable, and uncensored AI model training and inference.

ğŸŒŸ Key Features.

Decentralized AI Computation: No single point of failure.  

Efficient and scalable: Making use of Somniaâ€™s high performance infrastructure.  

Affordable Model Training: We are completely eliminating reliance on centralized providers.

Privacy preserving AI workload: Data remains secure and distributed.  

---> Project Goals:

1. Build a decentralized marketplace for AI compute power.  
2. Enable permissionless access to AI infrastructure.
3. Support machine learning model training and inference in Web3.  

---> Tech Stack.

- Blockchain: Somnia.
- AI Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- Smart Contracts: Solidity, Rust. (TBD)  
- Storage: IPFS.
- Backend: Node.js / Python  (TBD)
