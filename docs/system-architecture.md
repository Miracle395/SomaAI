SomaAI System Architecture.

Components:

1. Compute Nodes: Provide GPU/CPU resources.
2. Task Allocator: Distributes AI workloads.  
3. Payment Smart Contracts: Handles payments in $SOM.  
4. Storage Layer' Stores model data (IPFS)
5. Web & CLI tools to interact with SomaAI.  

Smart Contract Flow:

1. AI developer submits a computation request.  
2. Smart contract escrows payment in $SOM.  
3. Compute nodes process AI tasks..  
4. Payment is released after verification.
