SomaAI: Decentralized AI Computation

--- Overview:

SomaAI is a decentralized network for AI computation, providing scalable and uncensored model training and inference on the Somnia blockchain.

--- Core Idea:

- AI developers can request computation power.  
- Node operators provide computing resources.  
- Smart contracts handle payments and task validations.  

--- Use Cases:

ðŸ”¹ AI model training without centralized servers  
ðŸ”¹ Privacy-focused machine learning applications  
ðŸ”¹ Web3-powered AI infrastructure
